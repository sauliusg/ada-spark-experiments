Matrix representations of the symmetry operators
================================================

"*Matrix representations and basis vectors:*  In order to obtain a
matrix representation for each of the point isometries for a given
group, we need to select a basis for each group.

To accomplish this, we will define, for each crystallographic point
group G, a set of bases such that the matrix representations of the
isometries is [sic] the same for any basis in the set and such that
the matrices are of a simple form. In fact, each entry of the
resulting matrices will be either 1, 0 or -1. In chapter 6 we will
show that every lattice left invariant by a point group G will contain
a sublattice that has a basis of the type we define for G in this
chapter and the next". (Boisen & Gibbs, 1990: p. 141)


"(D6.2) *Definition:* A matrix T all of whose entries are integers is
called an _integral matrix_.  If, in addition det(T) = Â±1, T is said
to be _unimodular over the integers_ or, for our purposes, simply
_unimodular_. If T is integral and det(T) = 1, then T is said to be a
_proper unimodular matrix_".  (Boisen & Gibbs, 1990: p. 200)
